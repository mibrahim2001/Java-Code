**<=========== Catching Exceptions with Superclasses ==========>** 

Use inheritance to create an exception superclass
(called ExceptionA) and exception subclasses ExceptionB and ExceptionC, where ExceptionB inherits from ExceptionA and ExceptionC inherits from ExceptionB. Write a program to demonstrate
that the catch block for type ExceptionA catches exceptions of types ExceptionB and ExceptionC.
