**<=========== Catching Exceptions Using Class Exception ==========>** 

Write a program that demonstrates how various exceptions are caught with catch (Exception exception) This time, define classes ExceptionA (which inherits from class Exception) and ExceptionB (which inherits from class ExceptionA). In your program, create try blocks that throw exceptions of types ExceptionA, ExceptionB, NullPointerException and IOException. All exceptions should be caught with catch blocks specifying type Exception.
