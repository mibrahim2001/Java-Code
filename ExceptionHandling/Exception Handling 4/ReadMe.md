**<=========== Rethrowing Exceptions ==========>** 

Write a program that illustrates rethrowing an exception. Define
methods someMethod and someMethod2. Method someMethod2 should initially throw an exception.
Method someMethod should call someMethod2, catch the exception and rethrow it. Call someMethod
from method main, and catch the rethrown exception. Print the stack trace of this exception.
